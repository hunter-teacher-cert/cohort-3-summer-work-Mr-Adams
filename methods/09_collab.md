Select an assignment from a class you have taught or will teach that you would like to incorporate group work into.
Select a groupwork approach/technique most suitable
Flesh out the "teacher-facing" parts of this assignment to address specifics how the groupwork component will be worked in. Address these, at minimum:
What are the intended benefits of groupwork over solo work?
Mechanisms for gauging how well it is working?
What to do when trouble erupts... (resistance to a grouping, lack of buy-in, "dead-weight" teammates, know-it-alls, etc.)
What instructions/guidance will students get re: the groupwork mechanics?
What long-term or class-wide goals does this support, and how?

# Collab
This would likely be an earlier lesson where I am going to introduce driver/navigator and the idea behind intentional roles and collaboration.
I know I will need this as a prodedure for the year to ensure strong and meaningful partner work for the year.
This would be introduce in their first game coding experience after some learning in the system:
