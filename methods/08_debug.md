# Debugging Technique: Using print statements to track flow

## General Usage
Code compiles and runs, but does not do what we want! 

## Array Practice - Looking at for loops
Before printing the entire array on one line: we can look at each index and its corresponding element to confirm we are incrementing correctly. We can repeat that for the reversed array to confirm the decrement

## Your task
* Compile the code below, then make a table to trace i and data[i] after each loop.
* What line of code would make each value printed on a diffrent line?
* What line of code would make the array printed on one line?
* Predict what will happen if you replace the 0 on line 36? compile and run to confirm your prediction. Explain what did you find out.

```java
public class ArrayPractice{
  
  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
    /* YOUR BRILLIANT CODE HERE */

    int [] data = {5, 8, 13, 7, 27, 2};
//Array values
    System.out.println("Printing in ascending order");
//Print a title
    for(int i=0; i<data.length; i++)
//Print array beging with  5 at index 0 through 2 at index 5      
     System.out.println("index [" + i + "] = " + data[i]);
    
    System.out.println();

  System.out.println("Printing in reversed order");
    for (int i=data.length-1; i>=0; i--)
     System.out.println("index [" + i + "] = " + data[i]);
   
  }
}
```
