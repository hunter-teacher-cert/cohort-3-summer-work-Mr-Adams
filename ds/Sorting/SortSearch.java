Sort Project:

Part 1:  (BASIC)
✔️  1. Analyze the two constructors - try to figure out how they work.
✔️ 2. Compile and run the program (SortProjectDriver.java and SortProject.java) and confirm
  the behavior of the constructors.

  Part 2: (BASIC)
✔️ 1. Read the description of findSmallestIndex and complete the method.
✔️2. Uncomment the lines in SortProjectDriver to test.

  Part 3: (INTERMEDIATE)
✔️  1. Complete the sort method - read comments for description
✔️  2. Uncomment the lines in sortProjectDriver to test.



Search Project:
  1. Complete the linear search (BASIC)
  2. Complete the binary search (Intermediate)//can't binary search on a non sorted list
  3. Complete the recursive version of binary search (Advanced)
