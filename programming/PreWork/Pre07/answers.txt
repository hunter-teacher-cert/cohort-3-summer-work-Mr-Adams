it is going to multiply each item in the array together to come up with one value.
kiwi starts as 1 so the first item in the array is just multiplied by itself
banana returns the single int value once all the multiplication is done
(2)
it will traverse the array and return the index of the array that equals the identified int value
grape is the value that we are searching for in the array (this is the example for 8.6)
(3)
it goes through the array and tests each 'pine' in a and if pine equals apple you add one to pear and then returns the total items in the array that equal pear.
apple is the int value we are counting in the array
pear is the variable that holds the count
pine is the variable the we are usign for each int in the array a.
